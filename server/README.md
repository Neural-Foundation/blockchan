# BlockChan Server
The BlockChan Server is a PHP service with a simple API to push and pop block chain message orders. It provides the push function for the BlockChan Client and the pop function for the BlockChan Agent. When the client pushes a new message to the server the latter will make a new order on http://CryptoGraffiti.info. Upon success the order data is saved on the server side and the client is replied with a success indicator. When the agent attempts to pop an existing message order, the server is supposed to answer with payment details and delete the order. Deletion is necessary to prevent the order from being popped twice as losing the order is the lesser evil in comparison to paying more than once for the same order. However, before the order can be deleted the server has to query CryptoGraffiti once again to get the payment details. Absence of the payment details must cause the pop function to fail for the agent. Eventually, when the order is successfully popped it is up to the BlockChan Agent to actually pay for it.
